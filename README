This is my first project in GitHub. 

The Matlab codes are used for 802.11a signal off-line analysis. 
  - Given rxdata sampled using USRP (20MHz), WritePacketOrder2.m will indentify the packet boundary, and store the results in variable list;
  - Given list outputed from WritePacketOrder2.m, FilterPackets.m will indentify well-defined packets (DIFS+T*Slots+PKT+SIFS+ACK), and packets without ACK;W

Note that the Matlab codes are for 11a signal. For 11b/g signal, you should change parameters in CheckIFSType.m and CheckPACKETType.m. Also, note that ISM crowded spectrum may ruin your measurement.
  
Some functions are still in development. If you are interested, please contact me directly.
